# Discord Chat Bot
***
Simple, spaghetti code bot made for my Discord server. Now with Deepseek & OpenAI (deepseek-chat & GPT 4.1 nano)!


__The normal chat commands (bot trigger is "=") are:__
* `ai <string>`: Bot will answer with ai (OpenAI GPT 4.1 nano)
* `ds <string>`: Bot will answer with ai - smarter but takes longer (deepseek-chat)
* `invent <string>`: Bot will sales pitch an invention from the prompt (deepseek-chat)
* `say <string>`: Bot says the string in text-to-speech and deletes your input so the bot appears to say it.
* `roll <integer>`: Make the bot randomly roll from 1 to the number you enter. e.g. =roll 50 rolls 1-50
* `8|is <question>`: Bot will answer with a classic 8-ball style response.
* `er`: Bot will say a randomly-generated Elden Ring style message.

__More chat commands:__
* `who <question>(optional)`: Bot answers who did the thing that you just asked [hard coded responses in large array].
* `why <question>(optional)`: Bot says why something happened by making up an answer using a random proper noun and "reason" [hard coded responses in large array].
* `when <question>(optional)`: Bot says when something happened by making up an answer using random time or date [hard coded responses in large array].
* `what <question>`: Bot tells you what the thing you asked is [hard coded responses in large array].
* `ballsize|bs <string>`: Bot will tell you the ballsize of the string in question [hard coded responses in large array].
* `size <string>`: Bot will tell you the size of the string in question [hard coded responses in large array].
* `meme` OR `random`: Respond with a random image from the database of meme responses.
